# Face-Detection-System (python + OpenCV)

An **Intermediate Level Project** built using **Python & OpenCV**.
This system can detect faces in  **real-time (webcam)**, from **images**, and from **videos**.
It supports multiple detection methods and provide useful statistics.

## Features
- **Webcam Face Detection** (real-time)
- **Image-based face Detection**
- **Video-basd face Detection**
- **Multiple Detection Methods**:
  - Haar Cascade (default)
  - DNN (placeholder - can be extended with pre-trained models)
- Eye detection inside detected faces
- Tracks **total faces detected** during a session
- Save detected faces as Images (screenshots)
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - 'q' :- Quit
  - 's' :- Save detected faces
  - 'h' :- Switch to Haar method
  - 'd' :- Switch to DNN method
